		Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. A little happy sunlight shining through there. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Anything you want to do you can do here.<br></br>
		This painting comes right out of your heart. This is unplanned it really just happens. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.<br></br>
Fluff that up. We have a fantastic little sky! This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Do an almighty painting with us. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Let your imagination be your guide.
